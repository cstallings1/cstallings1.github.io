      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">A personal reflection</h2>
      <h3 class="date">January 14, 2016</h3>
      <p>
        I'm so thankful that building a personal website was integrated into the curriculum at Dev Bootcamp. The process of building this website from scratch was difficult, time consuming, and so rewarding. And I don't plan to stop working on it once I've finished Dev Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building this website without using Bootstrap or Jekyll really put my HTML and CSS skills to the test and I needed that as a beginner. But HTML and CSS were only a part of the challenge, designing the layout of the site was also a huge learning experience. It seems simple until you sit down with a blank wireframing template and start to design your site. Once I setted on a general layout for my site it was a lot of fun designing it and picking out fonts, colors, etc. I learned a lot about managing my time and creating a minimum viable product which I think is an important skill as a developer. This is an aspect of developing that I didn't think too much about until I really started getting into it and had real deadlines for assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a blog was also a big learning experience for me, not only as a developer but on a personal level as well. I'm an introvert by nature so it pushed me out of my comfort zone to write about concepts that were new to me and put them out there for anyone to read. I definitely see the benefits of blogging as a way to solidify concepts and give back to the community. This is also something I plan to continue throughout my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving forward I would like to continue to improve my website and get experience using a framework. I also plan to improve the responsiveness of my site on different screen sizes. I'm looking forward seeing the progression of my site as I continue to develop my skills.
