            Hello again. I can't believe it's already the fifth week of Dev Boocamp - time is really flying. We've been studying Ruby for the past week and a half and I've learned a lot in a short time. In my last post we looked at the differences between a hash and an array. To really solidify this concept I'm going to discuss a method that takes data (this could be an array) and returns a hash grouped by a given condition. This is called the .group_by method.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's look at a really simple example to get a feel for how it works:
          </p>
          <p><code>(1..10).group_by {|n| n % 2 == 0}</code></p>
          <p><code>OUTPUT:<br>{false=>[1, 3, 5, 7, 9], true=>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]}</code></p>
          <p>
            So what we did was call the .group_by method on a range of numbers from 1 to 10. Then we wrote a block of code that iterated over each number in the range and assigned it as either true or false. If a number was evenly divisible by 2 (and therefore even) it was assigned to true; otherwise the number was assigned to false. Notice that the output of this method will always be a hash with an array as the value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's look at one more example that has a little more real world practicality. Let's say we have an array of arrays. Each element in the array contains a student's name and age. We need to quickly group the students by age. This is easily done now that we know the .group_by method:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>
              students = [["Jane", 10], ["Bob", 12], ["Sally", 13], ["Joe", 12], ["Mark", 10], ["Lisa", 13]]
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>
              students.group_by {|s| s[1]}
            </code>
          </p>
          </p>
          <p><code>OUTPUT:<br>{10=>[["Jane", 10], ["Mark", 10]], 12=>[["Bob", 12], ["Joe", 12]], 13=>[["Sally", 13], ["Lisa", 13]]}</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, we called .group_by on the students array. Then we iterated through each element in the array (which was an array itself) and grouped by the second element of the inner array - age. Notice we had to use s[1] to get the second array element because an array's index starts counting at 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think what makes this method unique is the fact that it returns a hash, this can be really useful when you are trying to organize associative data. I hope these examples gave you a better picture of how you can actually start using arrays and hashes to organize data. That's the basis of the .group_by method and I'm hoping you can take these simple examples and apply them to larger problems you may be working on.

<!--
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It went smoothly and a lot faster than I thought it would. It actually helped me wireframe more efficiently because I felt more pressure to make a design decision. When I was wireframing alone I tended to get caught up playing with different layouts and not making a quick decision.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Although tedious at times, I do think that it helped me in the development process. I was able to focus on just the layout and not get distracted thinking about fonts and colors right off the bat.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided a good wireframe was not overly complicated but showed enough detail to make it clear what the layout of the site would look like. We made a simple layout with the main focus being the content of the blog post.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I didn't learn about any new semantics in this challenge. It really built off all the other HTML challenges I've been working on this week.
