    <h1>Loops in Ruby vs JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      Loops are an important part of programming and a great way to reduce repetition in your code. This review shows the differences and similarities between the most common loops in Ruby and JavaScript. I'll give a brief explanation and code snippet of each loop in the the different languages. I'll use a simple example of counting to 5 to illustrate.

      <h2>Ruby</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>For Loop</h3>
          <p>Executes a block of code once for each element in a given expression. In the example below the expression is a range of numbers, you could use an array as the expression and iterate over each element in the array. However, you'll see the #each method being used for the application a lot in Ruby.</p>
          <pre><code>
            for x in (1..5)
              puts "Variable x is: #{x}"
            end
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            Variable x is: 1
            Variable x is: 2
            Variable x is: 3
            Variable x is: 4
            Variable x is: 5
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>While loop</h3>
          <p>Executes a block of code while a given conditional statement is true. You need to initialize the variable outside the loop and increment it at every loop.</p>
          <pre><code>
            x = 1

            while x <= 5 do
              puts "Variable x is: #{x}"
              x += 1
            end
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            Variable x is: 1
            Variable x is: 2
            Variable x is: 3
            Variable x is: 4
            Variable x is: 5
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Loop do</h3>
          <p>Loop do allows you to loop continuously until a conditional statement inside the loop is true. You use the keyword 'break' to break the loop. This keyword is seen in both Ruby and JavaScript.</p>
          <pre><code>
            x = 1

            loop do
              puts "Variable x is: #{x}"
              x += 1
              break if x > 5
            end
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            Variable x is: 1
            Variable x is: 2
            Variable x is: 3
            Variable x is: 4
            Variable x is: 5
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Until loop</h3>
          <p>Executes a block of code until a given conditional is true, or you could say it executes while a given a conditional is false. This loop is not used in JavaScript.</p>
          <pre><code>
            x = 1

            until x > 5 do
              puts "Variable x is: #{x}"
              x += 1
            end
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            Variable x is: 1
            Variable x is: 2
            Variable x is: 3
            Variable x is: 4
            Variable x is: 5
          </code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>For loop</h3>
          <p>The for loop in JavaScript accepted three statements. Statement 1 initializes a variable, statement 2 defines the condition, and statement 3 is executed after the loop has been executed, it's used as an incrementer.</p>
          <pre><code>
            for (var x = 1; x <= 5; x++) {
              console.log("Variable x is " + x)
            }
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            Variable x is 1
            Variable x is 2
            Variable x is 3
            Variable x is 4
            Variable x is 5
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>While loop</h3>
          <p>Executes a given block of code while a condition is true. This is pretty similar to the Ruby while loop except for the additional brackets and the keyword 'do' is not needed for JavaScript.</p>
          <pre><code>
            var x = 1

            while (x <= 5) {
              console.log("Variable x is " + x);
              x++;
            }
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            Variable x is 1
            Variable x is 2
            Variable x is 3
            Variable x is 4
            Variable x is 5
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Do..while</h3>
          <p>This is a different way of writing the while loop above and somewhat similar to loop do in Ruby. Make sure you add those parenthesis around the conditional statement or you'll get an error. JavaScript is pickier than Ruby about syntax.</p>
          <pre><code>
            var x = 1

            do {
              console.log("Variable x is " + x);
              x++;
            }
            while (x <= 5);
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            Variable x is 1
            Variable x is 2
            Variable x is 3
            Variable x is 4
            Variable x is 5
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>For..in</h3>
          <p>The for in loop is useful for looping through object properies. An object is similar to a Ruby hash so you can think of it like iterating over the keys in a hash. In the example below I've shown how to access the property and the value using this type of loop.</p>
          <pre><code>
            var person = {firstName: "Catie", lastName: "Stallings", age: 25}

            for (var x in person) {
              console.log("Property: " + x);
              console.log("Value: " + person[x]);
            }
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            Property: firstName
            Value: Catie
            Property: lastName
            Value: Stallings
            Property: age
            Value: 25
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>For..of</h3>
          <p>Similar to the for in loop but the for of loop iterates over the values of an iterable object, such as an array. If we had used a for of loop in this next example, instead of returning the values in the array, it would have returned the index of the current value.</p>
          <pre><code>
            var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

            for (var x of numbers) {
              console.log("The value of x is: " + x);
            }
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
            The value of x is: 1
            The value of x is: 2
            The value of x is: 3
            The value of x is: 4
            The value of x is: 5
          </code></pre>
