          <p>For this project learned about manipulating JavaScript objects on the DOM by converting a simple console game I created to an interactive game with graphics.
          </p>
          <p>The game is very simple - simply avoid the alien and make your way back to the spaceship. You can try the game out here: <a target="_blank" href="../javascript-game/index.html"><span class="bold">link</span></a>.</p>

<!--
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It went smoothly and a lot faster than I thought it would. It actually helped me wireframe more efficiently because I felt more pressure to make a design decision. When I was wireframing alone I tended to get caught up playing with different layouts and not making a quick decision.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Although tedious at times, I do think that it helped me in the development process. I was able to focus on just the layout and not get distracted thinking about fonts and colors right off the bat.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided a good wireframe was not overly complicated but showed enough detail to make it clear what the layout of the site would look like. We made a simple layout with the main focus being the content of the blog post.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I didn't learn about any new semantics in this challenge. It really built off all the other HTML challenges I've been working on this week.
