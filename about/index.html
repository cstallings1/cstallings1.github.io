          I think you've figured out by now who I am but I just wanted to give a little more background on what brought me to Dev Bootcamp.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 2012 I got my bachelor's degree in Business Administration, got my first job and everything was great. Fast forward a few years later and I found myself with a desire to take my education a step further and pursue something that I had become very interested in - programming. It started with a CodeAcademy course and took off from there, I knew I wanted to pursue this as a career but really didn't want go back to the traditional education system.
         </p>
         <p>
          This brings me to where I am today - fully immersed in programming at Dev Bootcamp. I'd heard about the program through some friends that had done it and it seemed perfect for someone like me looking for a different educational experience. So far so good - I'm loving my experience and cannot wait to get started with a career in software development.
