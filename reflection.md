####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned first hand how tricky it can be to get these properties to work together to position your elements on your webpage. Using the box-sizing property with a value of border-box helped make it a little less complicated by allowing me to include the padding and border in the width and height. I also learned how much changing your border width affects the positioning of the contents.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I really saw the importance of creating re-usable classes in HTML to help with the CSS positioning. When I started using HTML classes to create a column layout I started to have more success in my CSS formatting. When I first started on the CSS I was trying to use padding and margin to position the elements, I quickly realized I needed to rely more on the display and position properties to get the basic positioning right.

####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Getting the actual content of an element to look how I wanted it to look was the easiest part for me. Changing font sizes, color, text alignment, etc. was definitely the easy part. Positioning all my elements on the page and getting them to stay where I wanted them was a lot harder and that's where I struggled the most. I eventually got everything to look right but not on all screen sizes. I ran out of time to get into responsive design and given that this was supposed to be an MVP I had to just call it good for now.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
For me it really helped to wrap an element in a div in HTML and then work on getting that element positioned right using CSS. Once I liked the positioning I would work on adjusing padding and margin to get the contents formatted correctly.
